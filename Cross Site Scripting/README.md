# Cross Site Scripting (XSS) 

### What is XSS?

1. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) allows an attacker to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
2. It occurs when a developer fails to properly sanitize or validate user input.

### How to Test for XSS

#### Passive Method

- When registering or interacting with a web application, insert XSS payloads into every input field you find.
- Monitor the application and responses to see if the payload executes at any point (this might happen immediately or later in the workflow).

### Project Includes

1. Learning basic JavaScript for XSS exploitation
2. Introduction to XSS
3. Types of XSS:
    - Reflected XSS
    - Stored XSS
    - DOM-based XSS
    - Blind XSS
4. A curated list of XSS payloads
